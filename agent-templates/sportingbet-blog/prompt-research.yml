For larger venues, emphasize the grandeur and scale; for smaller ones, focus on the intimate atmosphere and local flavor. The scene could include a packed stadium, a lively fan zone, a city street filled with supporters, etc. Be creative here. Incorporate creative visual elements that convey the intensity and drama of the event, while maintaining a consistent visual language characterized by a bold and bright color palette, sharp lines and geometric shapes, high-contrast lighting with deep shadows, and a mix of textured and smooth surfaces. The visual style should be modern, edgy, and attention-grabbing, with a sense of energy and movement that draws the viewer in. The image should be perfect for a sports betting blog, evoking the thrill of the game and the rush of placing a bet."
